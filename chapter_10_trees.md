# Trees

## Binary Trees

Binary Trees are perhaps the most pervasive data structure in computer science. Let's take a moment to go over the basic characteristics of a Binary Tree before we explore algorithms that utilize this structure.

### **What is a Graph?**

Before we define what a Tree is, we must first understand the definition of a Graph. A graph is a collection of nodes and any edges between those nodes. You've likely seen depictions of graphs before, they usually exist as circles (nodes) and arrows (edges) between those circles. Below are few examples of graphs:

For now, you can ignore the blue coloring. Notice how the graphs above vary greatly in their structure. A graph is indeed a very broad, overarching category. In fact, linked lists and trees are both considered subclasses of graphs. We'll cover algorithms that operate on a general graph structure later, but for now we want to focus on what graphs are trees and what graphs are not. It's worth mentioning that a single node with no edges (image 1) is considered a graph. The empty graph (a graph with 0 nodes and 0 edges, not pictured :)) is also still a graph. This line of thinking will help us later when we design graph algorithms.
