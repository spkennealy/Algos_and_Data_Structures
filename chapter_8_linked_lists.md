# Linked Lists

In the university setting, it’s common for Linked Lists to appear early on in an undergraduate’s Computer Science coursework. While they don't always have the most practical real-world applications in industry, Linked Lists make for an important and effective educational tool in helping develop a student's mental model on what data structures actually are to begin with.

Linked lists are simple. They have many compelling, reoccurring edge cases to consider that emphasize to the student the need for care and intent while implementing data structures. They can be applied as the underlying data structure while implementing a variety of other prevalent abstract data types, such as Lists, Stacks, and Queues, and they have a level of versatility high enough to clearly illustrate the value of the Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

They also come up in software engineering interviews quite often.
