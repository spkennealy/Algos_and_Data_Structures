# Naive Sorting Algorithms

### **Bubble Sort**

Bubble Sort is generally the first major sorting algorithm to come up in most introductory programming courses. Learning about this algorithm is useful educationally, as it provides a good introduction to the challenges we face when tasked with converting unsorted data into sorted data, such as conducting logical comparisons, making swaps while iterating, and making optimizations. It's also quite simple to implement, and can be done quickly.

However...to be quite honest...

Bubble Sort is almost never a good choice in industry. simply because:
* It is not efficient.
* It is not commonly used.
* There is some n00bish stigma attached to using it :)

So don't be that engineer.

That said, it is quite useful as an educational base for us, and as a conversational base for you while interviewing, because we can discuss how other more elegant and efficient algorithms improve upon it, and taking naive code and improving upon it by weighing the technical tradeoffs of your other options is 100% the name of the game when trying to level yourself up from a junior engineer to a senior engineer.
